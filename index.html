            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!--
            * Brief overview of the project
            * Statement of the main goal: creating a repository for your field
            * Hook to engage the reader
            -->
            <p>Befitting to our group's composition of computer science and engineering majors, we structured the
                multimodal repository as a no-frills HTML-CSS-made website.</span> The home page is where you are
                reading this written rationale right now, and each site tab links to one of our members' six, personal
                entries. Each site also contains embedded visual elements and an MLA-formatted works cited page.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <!--
            * Detailed explanation of specific project objectives
            * How these goals align with creating a comprehensive repository
            * Importance of these goals to the field
            -->
            <p>The goal of the project is to compile together a comprehensive repository of information related to
                computer science, computer engineering, and robotics. These topics were specifically categorized as
                peer-reviewed articles, which disclosed current events relevant to computing, pertinent platforms that
                serve as widely popular programming-related tools, glossary terms that demystified field-specific
                jargon, or social and cultural ways to engage within the discipline. The variety in our team’s entries
                demonstrates how the repository is representative of several different career fields within the greater
                computing namesake, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, web development, data science,
                and computer aided design.</p>
            <p>It would be conducive for someone who is seeking to pursue a CS, CE, or robotics career to peruse this
                repository, as it contains several insightful resources concerning a specific career’s required
                knowledge, technical skills, or topical trends.</p>

            <h2>Repository Structure and Content</h2>
            <!--
            * Overview of the repository's organization
            * Types of information included
            * How the structure supports the project goals
            -->
            <p>Befitting to our group’s composition of computer science and engineering majors, we structured the
                multimodal repository as a no-frills HTML-CSS-made website. The home page is where you are reading this
                written rationale right now, and each site tab links to one of our members’ six, personal entries. Each
                site also contains embedded visual elements like diagrams and video tutorials, “previous” and “next”
                buttons to transition from one page to the next, and an MLA-formatted works cited. Formatting our
                repository as a website demonstrates how the application of programming skills can streamline the
                presentation of information, as the site is easy to navigate and contains interactive components like
                buttons, jump links, and hyperlinks to optimize a user’s experience.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments and Features</h2>
            <!--
            * Key features of the repository
            * How these features contribute to achieving the project goals
            * Unique aspects that set this repository apart
            -->
            <p></p>

            <h2>Future Growth and Development</h2>
            <!--
            * Potential areas for expansion
            * Plans for keeping the repository up-to-date
            * Opportunities for user contributions or collaborations
            -->
            <p></p>

            <h2>Identified Gaps and Limitations</h2>
            <!--
            * Current limitations of the repository
            * Areas where more information is needed
            * Challenges faced and how they might be addressed
            -->
            <p></p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <!--
            * Recap of the project's significance
            * Call to action for users or potential contributors
            * Final thoughts on the repository's impact on the field
            -->
