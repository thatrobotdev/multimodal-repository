            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!--
            * Brief overview of the project
            * Statement of the main goal: creating a repository for your field
            * Hook to engage the reader
            -->
            <p id="jump">The field of computing is a vast, information-dense, and quickly changing landscape of emerging
                technologies and innovations. As a first-year computing student at Georgia Tech in the computer science,
                computer engineering, and robotics fields, it can be hard to know where to start learning about the
                field when the volume of information is immense and constantly growing. This website hosts a selected
                multimodal repository of introductory content related to the fields of <a
                    href="natural-language-processing.html">Natural Language Processing</a>,
                <a href="accessible-interfaces.html">Accessible Interfaces</a>, <a
                    href="optimization.html">Optimization</a>, <a href="machine-learning.html" Machine Learning></a>,
                and <a href="computer-engineering.html">Computer Engineering</a>. Our goal is to help
                spark interest or curiosity in these subjects, creating a useful resource and repository for computing.
            </p>
            <p>Our group composes of computer science and engineering majors, with a range of different perspectives on
                an interesting introduction to a subtopic of computing. To implement our goal in a self-documenting
                format, we built our repository on a website using the web technologies and design patterns that we
                share about in the repository. Each page contains embedded visual elements, and an MLA-formatted works
                cited page inviting readers to dive in with multiple modes of connection to each topic.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <!--
            * Detailed explanation of specific project objectives
            * How these goals align with creating a comprehensive repository
            * Importance of these goals to the field
            -->
            <p>The goal of the project is to compile together a comprehensive repository of information related to
                computer science, computer engineering, and robotics. To create a diverse repository, we decided to
                select topics with overlap in each field that allows us to offer an individualized perspective on the
                field. So, we chose to highlight <a href="natural-language-processing.html">Natural Language
                    Processing</a>,
                <a href="accessible-interfaces.html">Accessible Interfaces</a>, <a
                    href="optimization.html">Optimization</a>, <a href="machine-learning.html" Machine Learning></a>,
                and <a href="computer-engineering.html">Computer Engineering</a> as our subtopics.
            </p>
            <p>We strove to introduce variety in each entry to make the repository truly representative of several
                career fields within computing, serving our goal to help inspire and spark new interest in the topics we
                care passionately about. Our repository is built for those seeking to pursue a Computer Science,
                Computer Engineering, or robotics career, as it contains many insights concerning each career’s required
                knowledge, technical skills, or topical trends.</p>

            <h2>Repository Structure and Content</h2>
            <!--
            * Overview of the repository's organization
            * Types of information included
            * How the structure supports the project goals
            -->
            <p>Befitting to our group’s composition of computer science and engineering majors, we structured the
                multimodal repository as a no-frills HTML-CSS-made website. The home page is where you are reading this
                written rationale right now, and each site tab links to one of our members’ six, personal entries. Each
                site also contains embedded visual elements like diagrams and video tutorials, “previous” and “next”
                buttons to transition from one page to the next, and an MLA-formatted works cited. Formatting our
                repository as a website demonstrates how the application of programming skills can streamline the
                presentation of information, as the site is easy to navigate and contains interactive components like
                buttons, jump links, and hyperlinks to optimize a user’s experience.</p>
            <p>To display a variety of approaches to each subtopic, we categorized sources as peer-reviewed articles,
                platforms pertinent to the field, glossary terms, and social and cultural engagement related to the
                subtopic. It was important to highlight peer-reviewed articles because by selecting high-quality
                writings from experts in each field, those who are new to the subtopic can experience the forefront and
                excitement of scientific discovery in a topic. By delving into pertinent platforms in each field, we can
                help contextualize widely popular programming-related tools and processes that allow a view into what it
                is like to work with computing tools every day. Selecting and defining glossary terms help to demystify
                field-specific jargon. Finally, by highlighting social and cultural ways to engage within the
                discipline, we highlight how people are changing the field for the better with exciting ways to get
                involved.</p>
            <p>By creating our repository as a website, we highlight many topics in computing as a self-documenting
                format. For example, we share about the importance of accessible interfaces while providing an example
                of an accessible interface by providing alternative text on the embedded images in the site for
                accessible technologies like screen-readers to read aloud. Our website also self-documents the
                open-source software development lifecycle as an open-source project hosted on GitHub, a platform and
                software development pattern we share about in the repository. Formatting our data in a website also
                helps us embed visual content such as diagrams, and video tutorials that are designed internet-first.
                This format also demonstrates how the application of programming skills can streamline the presentation
                of information, as the site is easy to navigate and contains interactive components like buttons, jump
                links, and hyperlinks to optimize a user’s experience. We include “previous” and “next” buttons to
                transition from one page to the next, and an MLA-formatted works cited at the bottom of each page with
                embedded links inviting readers to dive in with multiple modes of connection to each topic. </p>

            <h2>Accomplishments and Features</h2>
            <!--
            * Key features of the repository
            * How these features contribute to achieving the project goals
            * Unique aspects that set this repository apart
            -->
            <p>This repository integrates a number of digital-first features unique to the digital format, which allow
                us to better achieve our project goals of highlighting topics in computing in a comprehensive
                repository. One unique feature that sets the repository apart are jump links to the MLA works cited
                section on each subtopic page. For example, there are times when a citation such as <a
                    href="#jump">(Byrne et al.)</a> can be hyperlinked to "jump" directly to its entry on a Works Cited
                page, creating a more accessible environment for readers who want to dive deeper into a specific topic
                or citation quickly. We also integrate <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> both as part of
                paragraphs to help direct readers to ourside resources, and as part of the MLA works cited to showcase
                digital-first resources. This digitization of the typically print-published MLA works cited format best
                supports learners who rely on digital content and organize their research digitally. Another unique
                feature is a "pill" interface design that differentiates different resources. For example, a
                peer-reviewed article would start with the <span
                    class="badge badge-pill badge-dark align-middle text-bg-primary">Peer-reviewed article</span> pill.
                This allows readers to scan the website quickly for the type of resource they want to investigate
                further. In our efforts to make navigation of the of the repository easier, we include "next",
                "previous", and navigation bar links on the tops and bottoms of pages to make it easier to go from page
                to page. For digital-first resources such as videos or papers we have elected to embed select resources
                into the site, allowing readers to directly interact with educational content without leaving the site
                in the context of the introductory reflections we have provided for each resource.</p>
            <p>One exciting aspect of the site in its design as an open-source programming project is that <a
                    href="https://github.com/thatrobotdev/multimodal-repository/">the code is accessible to the world
                    for free on GitHub</a>. In common practice with other open-source
                software projects, the code is released under the MIT License, which states
