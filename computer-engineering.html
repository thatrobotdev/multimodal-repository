          Systems Design
          Title</a>
      </h2>
      <p> Many in the field of computing may be familiar with Moore’s Law, the observation that transistor count in
        integrated
        circuits doubles roughly every two years. In recent years, however, the pattern has started to break down. As
        transistors
        begin to reach smaller sizes that push against the boundaries of physics, it has become increasingly difficult
        to pack more
        transistors and exponentiate the performance of new chips. In light of these concerns, some design optimizations
        have been
        made. Companies have replaced singular powerful CPU cores with an increased number of lightweight processors,
        and
        manufacturers have begun dedicating over half the surface area of chips to accelerators. These improvements come
        with
        their own challenges, however; rapidly evolving computer architecture offers less portability from software from
        one
        generation to another, which opens the floor to reliability and security concerns.
      </p>
      <p> As of now, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is taking measures to mitigate this dramatic shift in Moore’s
        Law.
        Funding is already being directed into research endeavors surrounding scalability, special purpose integrated
        circuits,
        and cybersecurity.

      <h2><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Platform</span> C/C++</h3>
        <p> Created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, C historically has been one of the most widely used programming
          languages.
          Its applications lie primarily in operating systems code, device drivers, and protocol stacks, where it can be
          found in devices ranging from microcontrollers and embedded systems to supercomputers. Unlike languages like
          Python,
          C is a low-level, meaning it provides closer access to underlying hardware and memory. Its standout features
          are
          being a compiled language that offers direct management of memory, optimizing it for fast execution times.
        </p>

        <p> C++ builds upon C to offer object-oriented capabilities, adding features like classes, inheritance, and
          polymorphism.
          Because of its better structure and flexibility, C++ is more suitable for much larger, complex software
          projects that
          require high performance, such as game development.
        </p>

        <p> Within Computer Engineering, C/C++ offer a balance between low-level and high-level programming to interface
          directly with computer hardware. From building basic projects with an Arduino microcontroller to designing
          firmware for the circuit boards inside a $200,000 solar car, C/C++ plays an important role in developing ECE
          products and is a valuable language to learn.

          <h2><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Platform</span> KiCAD</h3>
            <p> KiCAD is a free electronic design automation (EDA) program used to design electronic hardware that can
              be
              manufactured into printed circuit boards (PCBs). First created in 1992, it has since gone through numerous
              updates
              to expand its features and capabilities. It is now most prominently used among hobbyists and educational
              teams.
            </p>

            <p> Applications of KiCAD range from designing a simple circuit using a microcontroller to taking on more
              robust
              and comprehensive projects involving hundreds of circuit components and large volumes of electricity.
              There are
              two primary design tools in KiCAD: the schematic editor and PCB layout tool. Creating schematics on KiCAD
              can be
              likened to drawing circuit diagrams on paper using common symbols; its purpose is to create a blueprint of
              a
              circuit before it is actually built. Once a schematic is finished, it can be exported to the PCB layout
              where users
              can construct the layout of physical components and send their final design to a PCB manufacturer, where a
              green
              circuit board will be constructed and shipped to them.
            </p>

            <p> Though there are alternative paid EDA software more widely used in industry, like Altium or EAGLE, KiCAD
              stands
              as one of the most versatile and comprehensive free EDAs. It is fully capable of designing electrical
              projects both
              large and small, making it a valuable program to add to an engineer’s skillset.
            </p>

              <span class="badge text-bg-primary">Glossary Term</span> IC and VLSI
            </h2>
            <p> IC refers to integrated circuits, or small chips comprised of multiple electronic components
              (transistors, resistors,
              capacitors) etched onto semiconductor material. They are fabricated via photolithography, a process by
              which UV light
              transfers patterns onto a single unit of silicon wafer. As opposed to using discrete circuit components,
              photolithography
              allows for a high density of transistors in a small form factor, allowing ICs to offer incredibly high
              performance.
              They can be found in virtually all modern devices because of their low manufacturing cost and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p> VLSI, or very-large-scale integration, refers to integrated circuits with millions or billions of
              components on a
              single chip, enabling the functionality of a CPU, ROM, and RAM among others to be localized in a condensed
              package.
              Every new generation of high-end processing devices like graphics cards and CPUs relies on adding more
              transistors or
              optimizing layout in VLSI. As small electronic components start to reach their physical limits, however,
              new means
              of improving chips are required.

            <h2><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Glossary Term</span> FPGAs
            </h2>
            <p> FPGAs, or Field Programmable Gate Arrays, are integrated circuits that can have their hardware
              reconfigured for specific
              use cases “in the field”. They are comprised of Configurable Logic Blocks, or CLBs, which contain
              registers, memory, and
              function generators that enable them to behave like logic gates. To reconfigure an FPGA, an engineer
              typically can place
              and route components by programming in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog. These languages
              generally
              have preexisting libraries that define complex functions for the programmers to use, expediting the the
              reconfiguration
              process significantly.
            </p>
            <p> FPGAs are used in a variety of applications that range from automobiles to space avionics. Especially
              for satellites
              and other spacecraft in orbit, the FPGAs become incredibly useful for reconfiguring their hardware systems
              remotely.
              FPGAs are also power efficient and can offer real-time response, making them well suited for safety
              applications
              like blind spot warning and cruise control. Due to their prevalence in hardware systems that aren’t
              explicitly
              related to computer chips, knowing how to program and use an FPGA is highly sought after.

              Makerspaces (the Hive)
            </h2>
            <p> One of the best environments to engage with computer engineering is building projects at the Hive,
              Georgia Tech’s ECE
              makerspace. The facility is equipped with a variety of tools, ranging from soldering irons to 3D printers
              to
              oscilloscopes. They also have an inventory of electronic components that are free to take—like resistors
              or
              capacitors—as well as more specialized components can be checked out with a Buzzcard. Open Mondays to
              Fridays from
              10AM to 6PM, the Hive staffs a number of peer instructors who are capable of supporting you in any
              project. Any
              student seeking to get hands-on experience in ECE skills can come to the Hive to get started
            </p>
            <p>
              Every now and then the Peer instructors host workshops that students can RSVP to attend. These cover a
              wide array
              of subjects; beyond teaching common ECE topics like how to use an Arduino, they lead miscellaneous lessons
              like how
              to make a candle or learn the inner workings of a combination lock. For any student out there, computer
              engineering
              or not, the Hive is a fantastic, free cultural means of engaging with the fundamentals of ECE.
