    <h1>Optimization: Data Science, Robotics, and Programming Tools</h1>
    <p>By Ethan Lu</p>

    <span class="badge badge-pill badge-dark align-middle text-bg-primary">Peer-Reviewed Article</span>
    <h3>Development and Implementation of Enhanced Shortest Path Algorithm for Navigation of Mobile Robot for Warehouse
      Automation (MRWA)</h3>
    <p>The article discusses a new approach to facilitating the movement of warehouse items using mobile robots. This
      device is called MRWA, short for Mobile Robot
      for Warehouse Automation. Specifically, the researchers attempted to localize the MRWA so it would choose the
      optimal, shortest path without colliding into any
      obstacles or other MRWAs. To localize the robot's movement, the researchers installed RFID (radio frequency
      identification) tags across the warehouse floor and
      equipped the MRWAs with complementary RFID readers. Some common RFID-tech items that we use today are credit cards
      and amusement park wristbands, which can be
      scanned when held close to an RFID reader. This innovation would enable MRWAs to carry items from one rack to
      another, since each floor panel has a unique RFID
      tag that would enable the robot to detect the starting point, build an optimal path, and arrive unscathed at its
      destination. In a long-term outlook, using MRWA
      robots aims to automate warehouse systems to become more efficient as well as reducing labor costs in its
      operations

    <h3>Jupyter Notebook</h3>
    <p>Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, browser-based interface for creating living documents called notebooks. As an
      open source tool, Jupyter Notebook enables users
      to distribute and modify publicly available programs, which makes it an attractive platform for active
      collaboration. Moreover, as a web-based application, Jupyter
      makes it more convenient for users to experiment with ideas and analyze data, since it doesn't require physically
      installing software on the devices. Another primary
      reason for its popularity as a "code prototyper" is its runtime flexibility. A user can run code in individual
      input
      cells, which essentially allow the user to test
      a certain block of code without having to run the rest of the code. Thus, it is very efficient to pinpoint which
      part of the program is causing an error by running
      each cell one-by-one. Jupyter Notebook uses built-in computational engines called kernels to support multiple
      programming languages within a notebook, such as Python,
      Julia, and C++. What Jupyter lacks in feasibility for coding large-scale projects is compensated by its
      convenience
      in running small blocks of code and deciphering
      potential errors <a href="#id_source2">(Project)</a>.</p>

    <h3>IDE</h3>
    <p>An IDE, short for integrated development environment, is an application that provides a comprehensive set of
      resources for software development. IDEs typically consist
      of a source code editor, a debugger, and a built-in executable tool. In layman terms, they enable programmers to
      write and edit code more efficiently through built-in
      shortcuts, colored text formatting, and line autocompletion. Moreover, IDEs can directly convert the user-written
      source code into machine language that the computer
      can execute and display back to the user. If there are any errors during the code's compilation or execution, the
      IDE will display what error was detected and where it
      is located in the program. IDE's built-in features offer users a more productive and streamlined coding
      experience.
      One IDE, Visual Studio Code, or VSCode, has gained
      popularity for its additional features, which include its customizable appearance, small download size, version
      control management known as Git integration, and its
      open-source codebase <a href="#id_source3">(Why)</a>.</p>

    <h3>EDA</h3>
    <p>EDA, short for exploratory data analysis, is a specialized process related to the field of data science. EDA is a
      programmable tool that investigates correlations and
      patterns among datasets, and these insights can help data scientists and analysis develop more complex large
      language models and machine learning algorithms. The range
      of EDA's usage is quite broad, as it essentially can be applied to any research question involving a large amount
      of
      data, whether it be a sports-related stat or a
      financial market prediction. In turn, the EDA will output basic features of the dataset, such as its correlations
      and trends, anomalies and outliers, and a fair foundation
      for a hypothesis. Some popular environments, where the code is executed, for EDA are Jupyter Notebook and Python
      Ecosystem, since they enable swift visualization, data
      cleaning, and code collaboration. Exploratory data analysis serves as a practical tool for fine-tuning one's basic
      understanding of a dataset before implementing it in
      more complex algorithms <a href="#id_source4">(Telang)</a>.</p>

    <h3>Hackathons</h3>
    <p>A hackathon is an event where participants, not necessarily hackers but rather enthusiastic programmers,
      collaborate on projects that seek to create innovative solutions
      to a given problem for a contiguous period of time of around 24 to 72 hours. Hackathons are great events to gain
      exposure to fostering innovation, collaborating effectively,
      networking with other bright individuals, and implementing and gaining programming skills. At the conclusion of
      the
      development phase, teams often present their project in
      front of a judging panel, after which an overall winner for the event is selected. However, hackathons serve as
      formative experiences for all who participate in them.
      Hackathons cultivate a collaborative culture and promote diverse participation since participants often come from
      various backgrounds and experiences. If the hackathon is
      in-person, one can possibly expect participants who travel long distances to compete. As a prestigious university
      driven to promote tech culture in the Southeast, several
      hackathons are organized by Georgia Tech's student-run clubs and held on the campus every year, such as HackGT, AI
      ATL, and Hacklytics <a href="#id_source5">(What)</a>.</p>

    <span class="badge badge-pill badge-dark align-middle text-bg-primary">Social/Cultural Engagement</span>
    <h3>Scratch</h3>
    <p>Scratch is a visual programming language that is targeted towards beginner programmers to learn basic coding
      concepts in an engaging manner. Scratch uses block-based
      programming rather than text-based programming to simplify concepts and negate complex syntax. It further
      implements
      a built-in graphical user interface and animated objects
      called sprites to create a visual interface that can be interacted with through coding. As an open source
      environment, users can freely share and remix their coding projects
      with others. This playful learning environment encourages a user to explore creativity by programming the sprites
      into game-like and story-time projects. Scratch is an
      effective tool to generate interest among young learners in gaining coding experience and potentially further
      exploring it as a possible career path. Many elementary and
      middle schools in the U.S. incorporate Scratch as a programming tool in their academic curricula, since it has a
      short learning curve, fosters a fun, interactive learning
      experience, and exposes more young students to computer science <a href="#id_source6">(Gautam)</a>.</p>
