      <h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A Review of Methods and Applications</h3>
      <p>Machine learning is becoming increasingly relevant in our society, with applications in industries like
        healthcare, finance, retail, transportation,
        and more. Significant research has been conducted in areas like computer vision, where algorithms known as
        convolutional neural networks help with
        object recognition and classification. Potential applications for this technology include medical imaging
        analysis, autonomous driving, quality
        control in manufacturing, and more. However, there still remain some concerns about data privacy/transparency
        and bias. As machine learning continues
        to grow, it is crucial that an ethical framework is established to ensure this technology is used responsibly.
        For instance, Generative Adversarial
        Networks (GAN) are widely used for image and video generation. A generator network creates data samples, and the
        discriminator network decides whether
        the data is real or fake. While GANs have much potential for advancing technology, they also raise concerns
        about misuse, such as creating deep fakes.
        Additionally, lack of transparency into how machine learning models’ decision-making processes has led to
        increased need for research into explainable
        AI (XAI). Some broader societal concerns around machine learning include its effects on the job market. While
        automation can improve efficiency, it
        could also lead to job losses. For this reason, there have been calls for policies regulating its use. Overall,
        machine learning has much potential to
        revolutionize various industries, but addressing challenges about privacy and ethical use will be essential to
        its future <a href="#id_source1">(Sharifi & Amini)</a>.</p>

      <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
      <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It involves the use of artificial neural networks to process and
        analyze data. These artificial
        neural networks mimic how the human brain works. There is an input layer, output layer, and hidden layer. When
        the neural network has three or
        more layers, it’s labeled “deep,” hence the name. The input layer includes neurons that receive input data, the
        hidden layers recognize patterns
        in the data, and the output layer gives the output of the network
        <br>
        <br>
        Types of neural networks:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Feedforward neural networks (FF):</b> Feedforward neural networks are one of the oldest forms of
          artificial neural networks. Data flows from the input layer to one or more hidden layers and then out the
          output layer. Data only flows in one direction.</li>
        <li><b>Recurrent neural networks (RNN):</b> RNN work in cycles where the output of the previous step is used as
          input instead of assuming that inputs and outputs are independent of each other.</li>
        <li><b>Long/short term memory (LSTM):</b> LSTM builds upon RNN by remembering information over the long term. It
          recognizes patterns over time by remembering important details and ignoring irrelevant ones</li>
        <li><b>Convolutional neural networks (CNN):</b> CNN are primarily used for image, speech, and audio signal
          inputs. It looks for patterns and breaks down details within its layers so that input can be classified</li>
        <li><b>Generative adversarial networks (GAN):</b> GAN use a generator that generates fake data that a
          discriminator must recognize from real data. They help with improving the accuracy of a model.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
      <p>Machine learning is a way of developing systems that can learn from inputted data without them being explicitly
        programmed. Machine learning models
        work by recognizing patterns in datasets and making predictions. There are three main types of machine learning
        models used: supervised, unsupervised,
        and reinforcement.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Supervised learning:</b> Supervised learning involves the use of labeled data. The model knows what it is
          being trained to recognize, and it is fed data of that specific output. For instance, if a model is being
          trained to recognize and image of an orange, it is only fed pictures of an orange that have been labeled as
          such.</li>
        <li><b>Unsupervised learning:</b> As opposed to supervised learning, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data.
          The model is given data, but does not know what the output should be. Instead, it categorizes the incoming
          data by similar attributes (such as separating apples from oranges) to figure out which group they should fall
          under. This type of model is particularly good for pattern recognition and descriptive modeling</li>
        <li><b>Semi-supervised learning:</b> Semi-supervised learning falls in between supervised and unsupervised
          learning. Some of the input data is labeled and some is not.</li>
        <li><b>Reinforcement learning:</b> Reinforcement learning is a “learning-by-doing” model where the model
          receives positive reinforcement when it performs well and negative reinforcement if it does not. An example is
          an algorithm learning to play a game, where positive reinforcement would be a series of moves that leads to
          the algorithm winning the game.</li>
