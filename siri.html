      <h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A Review of Methods and Applications</h3>
      <p>Machine learning is becoming increasingly relevant in our society, with applications in industries like healthcare, finance, retail, transportation, 
        and more. Significant research has been conducted in areas like computer vision, where algorithms known as convolutional neural networks help with 
        object recognition and classification. Potential applications for this technology include medical imaging analysis, autonomous driving, quality 
        control in manufacturing, and more. However, there still remain some concerns about data privacy/transparency and bias. As machine learning continues 
        to grow, it is crucial that an ethical framework is established to ensure this technology is used responsibly. For instance, Generative Adversarial 
        Networks (GAN) are widely used for image and video generation. A generator network creates data samples, and the discriminator network decides whether 
        the data is real or fake. While GANs have much potential for advancing technology, they also raise concerns about misuse, such as creating deep fakes. 
        Additionally, lack of transparency into how machine learning models’ decision-making processes has led to increased need for research into explainable 
        AI (XAI). Some broader societal concerns around machine learning include its effects on the job market. While automation can improve efficiency, it 
        could also lead to job losses. For this reason, there have been calls for policies regulating its use. Overall, machine learning has much potential to 
        revolutionize various industries, but addressing challenges about privacy and ethical use will be essential to its future.</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>Python is one of the most widely used coding languages in machine learning. It is ideal for machine learning because of its simplicity, which makes it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike. Python contains many libraries, which 
        are like collections of prewritten code that can help a user program more efficiently. For machine learning, libraries can help with data manipulation 
        and reduce the amount of code to be written. Python’s growing community of users ensures that libraries stay up-to-date, with some examples including: 
        SciKit-learn, TensorFlow, and NumPy.
        <ul>
          <li><b>SciKit-learn:</b> SciKit-learn is one of the most popular Python libraries for machine learning. It simplifies building and testing of machine learning models.</li>
        <li><b>TensorFlow:</b> TensorFlow was developed by Google and is primarily used for deep learning applications. It helps with training deep neural networks.</li>
        <li><b>NumPy, SciPy, Pandas:</b> NumPy is used for scientific and technical computing. SciPy and Pandas both build on NumPy. NumPy is good for analyzing tables of 
          data, SciPy helps with optimization and statistical analysis, and Pandas help with data cleanup and manipulation.</li>

        <h3>Machine Learning Conferences</h3>
        <p>Machine learning conferences are great places for sharing research and bringing together people of a wide range of backgrounds. There are three 
          major conferences that happen each year: 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS):</b> Interdisciplinary conference that includes machine learning talks, demonstrations, and presentations of research papers. Also has a professional exposition to display machine learning in practice with tutorials and workshops.</li>
            <li><b>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML):</b> Founded in 1980, publishes research on machine learning and its applications machine vision, computational biology, speech recognition, and robotics. Also explore its relation to artificial intelligence, statistics, and data science. Attended by people like researchers, entrepreneurs, and engineers. Next one going to be held in Vancouver Convention Center from July 13th-19th 2025</li>
            <li><b>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR):</b> Specifically geared towards advancement of deep learning. Also publish research and explore connections between deep learning and fields like artificial intelligence and data science. Other topics explored include optimization of deep learning, theoretical issues, applications in audio, speech, robotics, neuroscience, biology, gaming, and other fields. The next conference will be held Apr 24-28th 2025 in Vancouver Convention Center</li>

        <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It involves the use of artificial neural networks to process and analyze data. These artificial 
          neural networks mimic how the human brain works. There is an input layer, output layer, and hidden layer. When the neural network has three or 
          more layers, it’s labeled “deep”, hence the name. The input layer includes neurons that receive input data, the hidden layers recognize patterns 
          in the data, and the output layer gives the output of the network
          <br>
          <br>
          Types of neural networks:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Feedforward neural networks (FF):</b> One of the oldest forms of artificial neural networks. Data flows from the input layer to one or more hidden layers and then out the output layer. Data only flows in one direction, hence the name.</li>
            <li><b>Recurrent neural networks (RNN):</b> Works in cycles where the output of the previous step is used as input instead of assuming that inputs and outputs are independent of each other.</li>
            <li><b>Long/short term memory (LSTM):</b> Builds upon RNN by remembering information over the long term. It recognizes patterns over time by remembering important details and ignoring irrelevant ones</li>
            <li><b>Convolutional neural networks (CNN):</b> Primarily used for image, speech, and audio signal inputs. It looks for patterns and breaks down details within its layers so that input can be classified</li>
            <li><b>Generative adversarial networks (GAN):</b> Uses a generator that generates fake data that a discriminator must recognize from real data. Helps with improving the accuracy of a model.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>


        <span class="badge text-bg-primary">Glossary Term</span> 
        <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a way of developing systems that can learn from inputted data without them being explicitly programmed. Machine learning models 
          work by recognizing patterns in datasets and making predictions. There are three main types of machine learning models used: supervised, unsupervised, 
          and reinforcement.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Supervised learning:</b> Involves the use of labeled data. The model knows what it is being trained to recognize, and it is fed data of that specific output. For instance, if a model is being trained to recognize and image of an orange, it is only fed pictures of an orange that have been labeled as such.</li>
            <li><b>Unsupervised learning:</b> As opposed to supervised learning, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. The model is given data, but does not know what the output should be. Instead, it categorizes the incoming data by similar attributes (such as separating apples from oranges) to figure out which group they should fall under. This type of model is particularly good for pattern recognition and descriptive modeling</li>
            <li><b>Semi-supervised learning:</b> Falls in between supervised and unsupervised learning. Some of the input data is labeled and some is not</li>
            <li><b>Reinforcement learning:</b> A “learning-by-doing” model where the model receives positive reinforcement when it performs well and negative reinforcement if it does not. An example is an algorithm learning to play a game, where positive reinforcement would be a series of moves that leads to the algorithm winning and vice versa.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
