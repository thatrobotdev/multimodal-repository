# multimodal-repository

The field of computing is a vast, information-dense, and quickly changing landscape of emerging technologies and innovations. As a first-year computing student at Georgia Tech in the computer science, computer engineering, and robotics fields, it can be hard to know where to start learning about the field when the volume of information is immense and constantly growing. This website hosts a selected multimodal repository of introductory content related to the fields of Natural Language Processing, Accessible Interfaces, Optimization, , and Computer Engineering. Our goal is to help spark interest or curiosity in these subjects, creating a useful resource and repository for computing.

Our group composes of computer science and engineering majors, with a range of different perspectives on an interesting introduction to a subtopic of computing. To implement our goal in a self-documenting format, we built our repository on a website using the web technologies and design patterns that we share about in the repository. Each page contains embedded visual elements, and an MLA-formatted works cited page inviting readers to dive in with multiple modes of connection to each topic.
