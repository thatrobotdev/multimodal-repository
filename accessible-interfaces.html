        <p>In this paper, researchers explore the use of smart toys to assess the suitability of dogs for service dog
          work. This is a significant area of research because service dogs are very time consuming and expensive to
          train. According to the paper, around 60% of dogs can fail due to behavioral issues, so a rigorous, accurate,
          and early diagnostic can save the organizations that train service dogs millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>To create an accurate diagnostic that is easy to administer, the paper explores creating "smart" toys that
          collect data as a dog interacts with them. The researchers created a chew toy ball that can approximate bite
          force, duration, time, and other variables that is provided to a predictive model. This model can then predict
          the service dog's outcome after training.</p>

        <p>In software, a library is a collection of resources that a programmer can use to implement software <a
            href="#rouse">(Rouse)</a>. For example, a library exists in many programming lanugages to help a programmer
          print text to the screen. When a software programmer utilizes the library, development can be made simpler
          because the programmer does not need to implement the code required to write text to the screen. Programmers
          can use libraries to reuse code for functions that they want to utilize often and to help simplify
          implementation of a feature to only need to be built once.</p>
        <p>React is a library that helps web developers build user interfaces (the elements that make up popular apps,
          webpages, and dashboards that people use everyday). In a <a
            href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/">survey of professional devlopers in 2024 performed by
            StackOverflow</a>, 41.6% of professional developers have done extensive development work with React in the
          past year, and wish to continue to work in React in 2025.</p>

        <p>When building a webpage, a traditional approach is writing the source code that will render the output that
          you want. This website was built with this traditional approach, with markup written in <abbr
            title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> that tells
          the browser from the top of the website to the bottom what to render. When building a website with React, you
          instead build components–tiny pieces of the website that you then fit together like a puzzle to define what
          the user interface should look like.</p>

        <p>In computer programming, an algorithm is "a set of instructions that is designed to accomplish a task <a
            href="#algorithm">(“Algorithm”)</a>. Writing an algorithm is how computer programmers tell computers how to
          solve problems. For example, what if you wanted to write a program that could tell you if a number is even or
          odd? You could write an algorithm that checks if the number is divisible by 2, then it is even, otherwise it
          is odd.</p>

        <p>Often, writing a precise algorithm for a task can be very hard. The task of making a peanut butter sandwhich
          is easily understood with verbal instructions, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8">if
            you wrote out a step by step list of the steps necessary to make a peanut butter sandwich there is a lot
            that can go wrong.</a></p>

        <figure class="figure">
          <img
            title="xkcd–“There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.”"

        <p>Another challenge can be writing an efficient algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that can solve a
          problem
          quickly and with as few resources (time/processing) as possible. This is a problem that computer scientists,
          programmers, and even mathematicians work on!</p>

      <figure class="figure">
        <img
          title="xkcd–“Neither group uses iso 8601 because the big-endian enthusiasts were all at the meeting 20 years ago.”"

      <p>Localization is a term in software development and other creative fields which, <a
          href="#merriam-webster">according to Merriam Webster</a>,
        means "to make local". When releasing a software project like a video game for a global audience, there may be
        some elements of the
        source material that requires modification for the project to be understood across cultural barriers. If
        software is designed for a language that is written from left to right, the user
        interface might need to be adapted to support languages that are written from right to left.</p>

      <blockquote class="px-3 text-bg-secondary blockquote">
        <p dir="auto">هذه الفقرة باللغة العربية ، لذا يجب الانتقال من اليمين إلى اليسار.</p>
        <p dir="auto">This paragraph is in Arabic, so you must move from right to left.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Jokes that rely on specific cultural knowledge or language features like puns may need to be rewritten to make
        sense in a target language. For example, in the game <a
          href="https://nivrad00.itch.io/purrgatory">Purrgatory</a>, originally written in American English, a reference
        is made to the popular American cereal Froot Loops. When the game was translated to European Spanish for a
        spanish audience, the reference to Froot Loops was changed to white chocolate, a more universal reference <a
          href="#torre-galán">(Torre Galán)</a>.</p>

      <table class="table table-bordered border-primary">
        <caption class="caption-top">Example of localization in Purrgatory</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Original text</th>
            <th scope="col">Localized text</th>
            <th scope="col">English translation of localized text</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="table-group-divider border-primary">
          <tr>
            <td>did you know all froot loops are the same flavor?</td>
            <td>¿sabías que el chocolate blanco no es chocolate en realidad?</td>
            <td>did you know that white chocolate isn't actually chocolate?</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Localization ultimately creates a derivative work, so there is not one correct style or way to localize a piece
        of software.</p>

        <p>Many pieces of software are developed in an open-source model, where the source code of the software is
          shared with other developers. This helps make software more secure, as the code can be reviewed by many
          people. Often, contributors can suggest features or fix bugs in the software, and the original developers can
          review and merge the changes into the software.</p>
        <p>
          Tools like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> keep track of software changes among multiple people, like a
          document revision history. This fascilitates the review and merging of code together from different
          contributors. Online code sharing platforms like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a
            href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, and others use
          these source control tools to allow developers from all over the world to collaborate and release their
          software.</p>
        <p>Open-source software is a different methodology to closed-source software, which is software that is not
          released to the public. This can lead to an imbalance of power between software vendors and users where users
          must trust the software vendor not to do anything malicious in their code, like embedding malware or tracking
          technologies. However, closed-source development allows proprietary technologies and intellectual property to
          be protected.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.eff.org/">The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a> is a nonprofit organization that
          promotes digital privacy, free speech, and innovation through internet activism. They were founded in 1990
          with the mission to "ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the
          world." <a href="#about-eff">(“About EFF”)</a></p>

        <p>They engage in political activism through litigation, <a
            href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hachette-v-internet-archive">like defending the Internet Archive against a
            lawsuit threatening its Controlled Digital Lending program.</a> They also defeated a patent on podcasting,
          <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/eff-wins-final-victory-over-podcasting-patent">which would have
            given one company control over the entire podcasting industry.</a> Their activism in the courtroom has
          protected the internet and the people who use the internet from unfair industry practices, predatory privacy
          harms, and freedom of speech challenges.
        </p>

        <p>As a technology-centered nonprofit, EFF also takes an important role in developing tools to spread awareness
          and prevent threats to online privacy and security. They built <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy
